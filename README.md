#### *  INSERT query 
The INSERT command is used to insert data into a table.

The SELECT command when used without the optional WHERE condition is used to fetch all data from a database table.If the WHERE condition is given, the command will fetch data respective to the condition.

#### * UPDATE query 
UPDATE is used to make updates to the data or row(s) of a database table.
